**Bank Churn Prediction**

Welcome to the Bank Churn Prediction project! üè¶

This repository houses our cutting-edge solution to the challenge of predicting customer churn in the banking industry. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we've developed a powerful predictive model that enables financial institutions to anticipate and mitigate customer attrition, ultimately enhancing customer retention strategies and driving business success.

**Key Features:**
- **Machine Learning Model:** Our predictive model utilizes state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze customer data and forecast churn probabilities with high accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing:** We've implemented comprehensive data preprocessing techniques to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation metrics ensure the reliability and effectiveness of our predictive model, allowing for confident decision-making.
- **Deployment with Flask:** Experience real-time predictions with our model deployed on the web using Flask, making it accessible to users worldwide.
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Engage with our user-friendly web interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JS, providing intuitive access to churn predictions.
